# ame_load:load/yes
# Admin confirmed AME load. Triggers the full initialization pipeline.
#
# GUARDS
# ------
#   - Gate must be open (#pending ame.load == 1)
#   - Already-confirmed calls are no-ops (idempotent)
#   - If called with no gate pending, silently returns 0
#
# WHAT HAPPENS
# ------------
#   1. Mark confirmed, close the pending window
#   2. Cancel the 5-minute timeout schedule
#   3. Tear down the ame.load objective (not needed after this point)
#   4. Schedule ame_load:load/all at t+1 (clean tick boundary)
#
# The 1-tick delay lets the scoreboard objective removal settle before
# ame_load:load/scoreboards runs and recreates its own objectives.

# Guard: no gate open
execute unless score #pending ame.load matches 1 run return 0

# Guard: already confirmed (double-call protection)
execute if score #confirmed ame.load matches 1 run return 0

# Mark confirmed — close window
scoreboard players set #confirmed ame.load 1
scoreboard players set #pending ame.load 0
