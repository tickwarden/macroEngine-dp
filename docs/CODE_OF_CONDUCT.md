# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, testers, and maintainers pledge to make
participation in this Minecraft Java Edition datapack project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal

We commit to fostering a community that is technically rigorous, respectful,
and collaborative.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Providing constructive feedback on datapack functions, commands, and architecture
- Reporting bugs or exploits responsibly
- Respecting different implementation strategies (scoreboard logic, storage patterns, NBT handling, etc.)
- Reviewing pull requests objectively and based on technical merit
- Taking responsibility for mistakes in code, documentation, or testing

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, flame wars, or hostile arguments about implementation style
- Publicly posting unpatched exploits without responsible disclosure
- Harassment in issues, pull requests, discussions, or external platforms
- Publishing private information without explicit permission
- Submitting intentionally malicious code (e.g., crash loops, backdoors, hidden command execution)

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers may:

- Remove or edit comments

Moderation decisions will be based on maintaining a healthy technical
environment and protecting contributors.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, exploitative, or otherwise unacceptable
behavior may be reported privately to the project maintainers via:

- GitHub private contact
- Security Advisory system

Do not open public issues for Code of Conduct violations.

All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled confidentially.

## Additional Datapack-Specific Policy
